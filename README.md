# Gareth Portfolio

This is a minimal starter portfolio scaffolded with Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS.

## Quick start

Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

Run dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```powershell
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Structure

- `index.html` - app entry
- `src/` - React source
  - `components/` - shared components (Navbar, Hero, ProjectCard, Footer)
  - `pages/` - page sections (About, Projects, Contact)

This is a starter. Replace placeholder text, add your projects and resume link, and customize styling as desired.
